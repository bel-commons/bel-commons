                <p>PyBEL Web hosts biological knowledge assemblies that are encoded in Biological Expression Language.
                    BEL supports the assembly of context-specific qualitative causal and correlative relations between
                    biological entities across multiple modes and scales in BEL Script with provenance
                    information, external namespace references, relation provenance (citation and evidence), and
                    relation metadata such as the biological context (anatomy, cell, disease, etc.).

                <h3>Upload and Parse</h3>
                <p>On the <a href="{{ url_for('ui.home') }}">home page</a>, click <a
                        href="{{ url_for('parser.view_parser') }}">Parse BEL</a>. In the form, choose a file, then click
                    "upload".</p>

                    that allow them to easily share networks with groups of other users. This is useful when multiple
                    curators are uploading related BEL Scripts. Later, they can be assembled and queried.

                <h3>Validate Namespaces</h3>
                <p>Large terminologies that are curated for projects investigating new diseases and pathologies can be
                    validated by checking their contents using the Ontology Lookup Service, provided by the EBI to
                    identify duplicate names and enable better semantic integration. </p>

                <p>From the home page, click <a href="{{ url_for('ui.view_networks') }}">List Networks</a>, find your
                    network, and select "Summarize".
                </p>
                <p>This web application organizes high level statistical information about a network, such as the
                    number of nodes, edges, author contributions, citation contributions, and provenance information as
                    well as global network statistics such as the average node degree, network density, number of weakly
                    connected components, etc. When appropriate, it proves feedback on syntax and semantics of the
                    source BEL document to assist in curation.

                 <p>Finally, the summary page provides an assessment of the "Biological Grammar", or the biological
                    validity of statements. These analysis include identification of contradictory edges,
                    unstable biological motifs in pairs and triplets of nodes, and other information that is inferred
                    to be missing or incoplete.

                <h3 class="panel-title">3. Exploration of the Knowledge Base</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="panel-body">
                <h3>Query Builder</h3>
                <p>A query contain three steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Assembly</strong>: A list of networks can be assembled. This is useful to integrate many
                        networks in the same disease area that have been produced at different times and in different
                        places. Additionally, this allows for integration of other static resources such as gene
                        families, orthology information, biochemical reaction databases, and other annotations to fill
                        in the most fine-granular information extracted from structured knowledge bases. We provide
                        several networks publicly for users to add to their assemblies.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Seeding</strong>: Large assemblies of networks are very difficult to view, especially
                        when
                        there is
                        a certain point of interest for the user. We provide several network seeding methods to create
                        a more relevant and managable network before performing general queries. For example,
                        subnetworks can be seeded around a given node or list of nodes, based on edges with certain
                        properties, or even by author or citation provenance information.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Mutation and Filtering</strong>: Networks can be modified using the entire
                        suite of tools provided by PyBEL. This includes filters for nodes based on certain properties,
                        expansion around nodes of interest, exclusion of nodes or groups of nodes, and more.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                        webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

                 <p>Finally, the results of queries can be summarized, downloaded in many formats, or explored.</p>

                <h3>Interactive Network Explorer</h3>
                <p>The results of query can be explored interactively with the Biological Network Explorer. Its
                    tools panel contains an extended query builder interface that can be used to apply additional
                    mutators and filters. Network algorithms can be readily applied to
                    networks such as path searches, centrality calculations, and overlaying of external data. These
                    data can come from differential expression experiments, or directly from the results of the CMPA
                    algorithm, which is explained below.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="panel panel-default">
            <div class="panel-heading">
                <h3 class="panel-title">4. Analyze a Knowledge Assembly</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="panel-body">

                <p>Data sets like differential gene expression can be used to quantify the perturbation amplitude
                    of biological processes in a network using an randomized algorithm based on NPA. Candidate
                    upstream mechanisms are generated for each biological process and a heat diffusion algorithm is used
                    to quantify the cumulative observed effect of upstream genes and gene products based on the
                    differential gene expression data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This algorithm is general enough that other data types could be used, such as copy number variations
                    on SNPs or clinical measurements of neuro-imaging features, which have been annotated to
                    our Alzheimer Disease Knowledge assembly with NeuroMMSigDB.
                </p>
                <p>Data sets can be directly uploaded and analyzed. The results of these experiments can then be
                    directly overlaid to the interactive network viewer to provide a data-driven analysis of
                    given networks or sub-networks.
